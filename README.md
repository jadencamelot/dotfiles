# Dotfiles

Personal dotfiles repo. Currently uses [Dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot) for installation.

Dotbot configuration is located in `.default.conf.yaml`.

## Usage

2. Run the install script with `./install`

Note that the install script is idempotent: it can safely be run multiple times.
